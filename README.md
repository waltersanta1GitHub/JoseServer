## Getting Started

To begin the execution process, follow these steps:

1. **Open Clientside**: In the JoseServer main project folder, you will find a subfolder named "JoseClient" that contains all the HTML code and js scripts. Open it

2. **Open JoseServer **: Ensure that you have a suitable JoseServer folder and open joserver.proj file.Afer that you need to update the nuegt packages and run the main program.cs

3. **Configure Token**: You need to configure the first token generated by the server application calling the default Get endpoint in http://localhost:8081. This configuration should be updated in the "index.js" file under the "token" variable with the value generated by the unique controller.
